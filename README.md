## Challenges Encountered

This was my second HTML and CSS project that required me to write code entirely on my own. While I tried to apply what I had learned and include as much as possible, thankfully, Visual Studio Code's IntelliSense helped me a lot.

One of the main challenges was using CSS to position the image in the center. I tried `display: flex;` and `justify-content: center;`, but I couldn't achieve what I wanted. Then, I searched and revisited previous learning materials, which showed me a very simple solution `margin: auto;` can fix it.

That's why I believe that continuous learning and practice are very important to prevent forgetting what I've learned.

## Problem-solving Techniques

When facing difficulties or confusion, I frequently rely on Google to seek the information I require.

Moreover, when seeking deeper comprehension, I turn to chatGPT, requesting explanations to aid in my self-study journey.

This approach has proven invaluable in helping me navigate complex topics more effectively, considering my current level of understanding.
